Malcolm Sambridge, the leader of the RSES Data Science theme, gave a seminar on the 6th of July at RSES about his latests thoughts and findings on using sparsity in geoscience data to gather more information about them. His talk briefly charted the history of nothing, and showed the power of nothing through a series of novel examples.

The concept of zero, sparsity, emptiness, or nothing has a long history in the development of civilizations, and our understanding of the world about us. Grappling with what is not, can have surprising benefits for understanding what is. Recently it has been discovered that exploiting the concept of sparsity or emptiness leads to powerful new ways to make physical measurements in the field or lab, and also solve previously intractable problems in fitting parameters to data. The solution of such inverse problems is of considerable interest in the Earth Sciences because many Earth properties and processes are not directly observable and so to constrain them one must rely on indirect measurements. An example is estimating properties of the Earth at depth from surface geophysical observables, or constraining past or hidden Earth processes from geochemical signatures.

The new results suggest that in particular situations exploiting sparsity may be a powerful approach to solving previously intractable problems. The conclusion outlined a possible way forward for utilizing these ideas in a range of settings relevant to Earth sciences.
